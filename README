Pong for 0-4 players.
Opens a square window, with four paddles(one on each side).
The paddles are controlled by up-to four potentiometers or other analog sensor plugged into an Arduino.
Every time the ball is hit, it's speed increases.
Every time the ball is missed it explodes, and the responsible paddle changes color.
At a certain point, the paddle will turn from red to gray,
 which means that that player is out and is now being controlled autonimously.
If there are less than four players, the other paddles will be gray(autonimous) from the start.
